            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p style="color: #aaa; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Last updated: November 25, 2025</p>
            <p>This Policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how we handle it when you create profiles,
                share links, and host images on <strong>khxzi.com</strong>. We keep analytics lightweight and do not use
                cookies for analytics. By using the Service, you consent to the practices described here.</p>
            <h3>Changes To Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>khxzi.com may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes take effect when posted on the
                Service or otherwise communicated to you. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date
                constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy, so please review it periodically.</p>
            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We collect only the information needed to run khxzi.com securely and reliably. When you create or manage
                an account, we receive basic account details that you provide, along with security information captured
                at the time of account actions to help prevent abuse. Passwords are stored using industry-standard
                hashing. We may also record the network address used at signup or login for fraud prevention and account
                safety. When you update your account email, we may retain previous email addresses for a limited period
                for account integrity, fraud prevention, or legal compliance purposes. These are not used for
                communication and are permanently deleted once no longer necessary.</p>
            <p>When you are signed in, we maintain a server-side session so you can stay authenticated across requests.
                That session record contains a session identifier tied to your account and limited context such as the
                device or browser type, an approximate country derived from your network address, and the network
                address itself. This information is used to provide secure sign-in, detect unusual activity, and help
                you manage active sessions.</p>
            <p>We run lightweight, cookie‑free analytics to understand how public profile pages perform and to attribute
                clicks on links inside those pages. When a visitor views a page or clicks a link, we log a minimal event
                that associates the action with the page owner, notes the referring site where available, captures an
                approximate country, identifies the general device type, and records the time of the event. We do not
                use cookies for analytics and we do not attempt to identify individual visitors beyond the signals
                described here.</p>
            <p>If you upload to the image host, we store information necessary to deliver and manage the file: the
                uploading account, descriptive and technical details about the file (such as name shown, size, and
                type), when it was uploaded, and optional folder information if you organize assets. We also record
                limited upload metadata such as the uploader's network address, browser and device information.</p>
            <p>If you contact us or receive service emails, we process your communications and related metadata so we
                can respond, provide support, and keep you informed about important changes to your account or to the
                Service.</p>
            <p>If you use an official khxzi.com application (including the desktop or mobile app), we may collect
                limited technical information to ensure functionality, maintain security, and improve performance. This
                may include app version, operating system type and version, device information, crash diagnostics, and
                anonymous usage metrics such as feature interactions or error events. No personal content or account
                data from your device is accessed or stored by the application. Certain actions within the app, such as
                uploads or authentication, are processed securely through our existing API infrastructure and follow the
                same data handling rules as when using khxzi.com in a web browser.</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>khxzi.com does not use cookies for analytics. We may use strictly necessary cookies or similar
                technologies to keep you signed in, protect your account, prevent abuse, and enable core functionality.
                These cookies are essential to the functioning of the Service and cannot be turned off in our systems.
            </p>
            <p>Our infrastructure is served and protected by Cloudflare, which may set its own cookies or use other
                identifiers for essential purposes such as load balancing, network routing, security, and DDoS
                protection. These Cloudflare cookies are technically necessary to maintain availability and protect
                against malicious traffic. You can review Cloudflare's cookie and privacy practices at <a
                    href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"
                    target="_blank">https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/</a>.</p>
            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the information described above to operate and improve khxzi.com; authenticate users and maintain
                secure sessions; display public profiles and links; measure page views and link performance without
                cookies; prevent fraud, spam, and abuse; provide support; process purchases and subscriptions; comply
                with legal obligations; and enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
            <h3>Marketing and Communications</h3>
            <p>If you choose to receive updates from us, we may send you occasional emails about new features, product
                updates, promotions, or other information related to khxzi.com. We only send marketing communications
                where permitted by law or where you have given explicit consent.</p>
            <p>You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link included in every
                message or by contacting support@khxzi.com. Opting out will not affect essential service communications,
                such as transactional or account‑related emails.</p>
            <h3>Legal Bases</h3>
            <p>Where required by law, we process personal data on the following bases: to perform a contract with you
                (providing the Service and paid features); for our legitimate interests (security, abuse prevention,
                service analytics without cookies, product improvement); with your consent where requested; and to
                comply with legal obligations and lawful requests.</p>
            <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
            <p>We keep personal data only as long as needed for the purposes described in this Policy or as required by
                law. Analytics events are stored with an automatic lifetime and are removed when they expire. Session
                records end when they expire or are revoked. Image‑hosting records remain while files are active or
                until their configured lifetime ends.</p>
            <p>When you request account deletion and the request is verified, we permanently delete your personal
                account data and user‑generated content from active systems. This process is irreversible. Limited
                system logs and backup copies may temporarily persist for security, integrity, or legal compliance,
                after which they are automatically purged.</p>
            <h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
            <p>We do not sell personal data. We share information with service providers who process it for us to
                deliver the Service (e.g., cloud hosting, content delivery, security, payment processing, email
                delivery, anti‑abuse tooling). These providers are bound by confidentiality and use limitations.</p>
            <p>We may disclose information if required by law or legal process; to protect the rights, safety, or
                integrity of users, the public, or the Service; or in connection with a corporate transaction involving
                the Service, in which case the successor will be bound by terms no less protective than those stated
                here.</p>
            <h3>Third‑Party Links and Services</h3>
            <p>khxzi.com may contain links to third‑party websites, services, or profiles that are not operated or
                controlled by us. When you follow a link or interact with content from another platform, any personal
                information you provide is subject to that third party's own privacy policy, terms, and data practices,
                not ours. We do not monitor, endorse, or assume responsibility for how these external services collect,
                use, or protect your information.</p>
            <h3>Payments and Billing</h3>
            <p>All purchases and paid upgrades on khxzi.com are processed securely through Lemon Squeezy, our authorized
                payment and merchant‑of‑record partner. Lemon Squeezy handles all billing, payment processing, and tax
                compliance on our behalf. This means your payment details such as card information, billing address, and
                transaction data are collected and stored by Lemon Squeezy in accordance with their own privacy and
                security policies.</p>
            <p>khxzi.com does not receive or store full payment card details. We only retain limited transaction records
                necessary for verifying your purchase, activating your account features, preventing fraud, and providing
                support.</p>
            <h3>International Transfers</h3>
            <p>Our infrastructure and service providers may operate in multiple countries. Where required, we implement
                safeguards for cross‑border transfers and apply technical and organizational measures designed to
                protect your information regardless of where it is processed.</p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal data, including
                encrypted transport, access controls, and routine monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is
                entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you suspect unauthorized access to your
                account, contact support@khxzi.com immediately.</p>
            <h3>Data Protection Rights</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may be entitled to certain rights under data protection laws such as the
                GDPR, the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act, or comparable privacy laws. khxzi.com recognizes these
                principles globally and allows all users, where applicable, to exercise similar rights regarding their
                personal data. You have the right to know whether we hold information about you, to request a copy of
                that data, and to obtain it in a commonly used digital format. If any of the information we hold about
                you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may request that it be corrected or updated.</p>
            <p>You may also request that your data be deleted entirely from our systems. Once your identity has been
                verified and your request is confirmed, we will permanently remove your personal information and
                user‑generated content from active systems, except where limited retention is required to comply with
                legal obligations, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, or maintain service integrity.</p>
            <p>If you believe we are processing your information unlawfully or beyond the scope of your consent, you may
                request that we restrict or suspend certain types of processing, or object entirely where the processing
                is based on legitimate interest.</p>
            <p>Where our use of your information relies on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time
                without affecting the legality of any processing carried out before withdrawal. khxzi.com does not
                engage in automated decision‑making or profiling that would have a significant legal or personal effect
                on you.</p>
            <h3>Children's Information</h3>
            <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13, or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction if
                higher. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children below the applicable age. If you
                believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact support@khxzi.com and we will take
                appropriate action.</p>
            <p>Any questions or concerns? Please reach out to support@khxzi.com. We will respond to all verified data
                requests within the time limits required by applicable law and may ask for reasonable proof of identity
                before taking action to protect your account and data.</p>
